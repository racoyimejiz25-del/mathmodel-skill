# Phase F Project-State Writer Inventory

Baseline: `main@0791432d9ab65c86b81d106274ed04731c510fd4`

This record scopes Phase F from `docs/semantic_state_runtime_refactor_plan.md`. It distinguishes repository control-plane writers from distributed task-code templates so transaction enforcement does not silently break the self-contained user-execution contract.

## Control-plane writers

| Writer | Current mutation surface before Phase F | Phase F action |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/sync_project.py` | `模型论文框架.md` → `state/project_state.yaml` → `sync_report.yaml` direct sequential writes | One recoverable `framework → state → report` transaction; staged hash/self-check before commit |
| `scripts/validate_semantic_governance.py --write` | Direct `state/project_state.yaml` write | Shared generation-checked state transaction |
| `scripts/validate_code_delivery.py` | Direct state write for preprocessing/primary/analysis delivery | Shared generation-checked state transaction |
| `scripts/validate_user_execution.py --write` | Mutates all selected receipts in memory, then one direct state write | Keep one in-memory mutation batch, commit through shared transaction helper |

All four control-plane writers must recover an existing prepared journal before loading mutable state and must reject a stale writer if the live generation changes before commit.

## Distributed template writer

`templates/code/hsk_pipeline/main_pipeline.py` contains a local `_write_state()` used by generated/user-executed task code. It is not a repository control-plane CLI and is intentionally self-contained: the template explicitly supports running as an independent script and cannot assume that the skill repository's `scripts/project_transaction.py` is present inside the user's modeling project.

Phase F therefore does **not** make this distributed template import the repository transaction helper. The authoritative acceptance path remains `validate_user_execution.py`; control-plane writes are transaction-protected. A future template packaging change may carry a project-runtime transaction library explicitly, but that is not introduced implicitly in Phase F.

## Test-fixture writes

Direct `write_text(yaml.safe_dump(...))` calls under `tests/` are fixture construction and fault injection, not production state writers. They remain intentionally direct so tests can construct legacy generation-less projects and simulate concurrent/partial state.

## Generation compatibility

- Missing `project.state_generation` is read as generation `0` for v8 compatibility.
- New transactional writes persist `expected_generation + 1`.
- The Schema exposes `state_generation` additively and does not require it for legacy reads.
- A prepared journal may roll forward only when live generation is either the journal base generation or target generation; any third generation blocks recovery.

## Writer serialization and stale rejection

Control-plane commits also take a project-local advisory lock at `state/.project_transaction.lock`. The lock only serializes the short recover/check/journal/replace critical section; it does not replace optimistic generation control and is not an external lock service. A writer keeps the generation captured when it loaded state. If another writer commits while it waits for the lock, the waiting writer sees the advanced live generation after lock handoff and fails with `GenerationConflictError` instead of overwriting current state. The lock file may remain as an empty hidden coordination file; journal/stage/backup files are still cleaned after a successful commit.

## Journal and recovery direction

Phase F uses deterministic roll-forward recovery. The journal records each target's old/new SHA-256, staged path, backup path, and base/target generation. On recovery, every live target must match either its recorded old hash or new hash. Unknown content is never overwritten or guessed.

For `sync_project --write`, replacement order is:

1. `模型论文框架.md`
2. `state/project_state.yaml`
3. `sync_report.yaml`

This order is recoverable because a crash after either the framework or state replacement leaves the prepared journal and remaining staged files for the next writer to finish safely.
